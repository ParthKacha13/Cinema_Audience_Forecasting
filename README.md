# Cinema_Audience_Forecasting
This project focuses on time-series forecasting of cinema audience attendance using data from both online booking platforms and in-theatre POS systems. By analyzing booking trends, holiday effects, theatre types, and historical attendance patterns, the model predicts daily audience counts for future dates.
